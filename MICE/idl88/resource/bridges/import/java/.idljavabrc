#
# IDL Java bridge configuration (Unix)
#
#
# Note: By default, on all platforms except 32-bit Windows, the IDL process
# is run in the same process as the IDL Workbench. In this case, the Java
# Virtual Machine used by the IDL Workbench is also used for the Java bridge,
# and any values set in this file or by any Java environment variables are ignored.
# The only exception is the JVM Classpath, which is still honored.
# To set JVM options to be used by Java bridge processes launched within the
# IDL Workbench, you should add the options to the idlde.ini file in your
# IDL bin directory.
# On 32-bit Windows, the IDL process is separate from the IDL Workbench,
# and all of the settings within this file will apply.



##########################
# Java CLASSPATH setting
##########################
#
#
#    This setting determines how the IDL-Java bridge finds its java classes.
#    It MUST be set in the config file if you wish to find any classes other 
#    than those provided by Java
#
#    If $CLASSPATH appears in the setting (as shown below), the value of 
#    the environment variable $CLASSPATH is substituted in this setting
#
#    Entries in Classpath should be separated by a colon on Unix
#
#    NOTE: This setting follows the rules of the -classpath option in the java 
#          or javac command,  That is, .jar files should be explicitly stated.  
#          If only a directory location is specified, Java will find .class 
#          files inside this folder but NOT .jar files


# Allow IDL-Java bridge to use .class files located in my CLASSPATH and also the 
# classes found in the examples .jar file shipped with the bridge

JVM Classpath = $CLASSPATH:/usr/local/harris/envi56/idl88/resource/bridges/import/java/jbexamples.jar



################################
# Java virtual machine locations
################################
#
#     JVM is required.
#
#     On Linux systems, set the environment variable
#     $IDLJAVAB_LIB_LOCATION to the location of your libjvm.so. This
#     value will be used when IDL runs the IDL-Java bridge from a
#     command line (terminal) or runtime session.
#
#     For example: 
#
#      setenv  IDLJAVAB_LIB_LOCATION /usr/java/jdkX.X/jre/lib/amd64/server
#
#     Note that under Macintosh OS X, IDL uses the version of
#     Java installed along with the operating system, and ignores
#     any value you place in IDLJAVAB_LIB_LOCATION.


#JVM LibLocation = 


###################
# JVM start options
###################
#
#   'JVM Option#'
#      There may be up to 20 additional JVM options specified.  These 
#      will be used when starting the JVM.  
#
#      NOTE: This is for advanced users only who understand JVM initialization
#
#      For example, a user that wants to reset the initial and maximum memory
#      allocated when the JVM starts, might do something like:
#        JVM Option1 = -Xms4m
#        JVM Option2 = -Xmx16m
#
#      NOTE: These options are unsupported options...thus their effects are 
#            implementation-dependent. It's possible that your implementation 
#            doesn't support them.

###########################
# IDL-Java Bridge debugging 
###########################
#
#
# Some limited debugging is provided via a log file.  
#
# 'Log Location':  Location where log files will be created.  
#                  Log files have format jb_log<pid>.txt
#
# 'Bridge Logging':  Level of debugging information logged to log file.  
#                    Possible options are:
#                    - SEVERE (default, bridge errors logged)
#                    - CONFIG (configuration settings logged)
#                    - CONFIGFINE (configuration settings logged, more detail)

#Log Location = /tmp
#Bridge Logging = CONFIG


##############################
# IDL-Java Bridge Reset Policy
##############################
#
# By default, the IDL-Java bridge persists for the duration of the IDL
# session in which it was created. This means that modifications to
# items in the Java Classpath are not loaded until a new IDL session
# is started. This policy allows the IDL-Java bridge to be configured
# to reset when the IDL executive command .FULL_RESET_SESSION is executed.
#
# 'Restart Bridge':  Policy for restarting the IDL-Java bridge.
#                    Possible options are:
#                    - False (Bridge does not reset during an IDL session)
#                    - True  (Bridge resets when the .FULL_RESET_SESSION
#                             executive command is executed)

#Restart Bridge = False
